# ArduCar
Simple Arduino based robot-car that can detect objects.
The project uses an Arduino Uno microcontroller, one motor driver, one servo motor, one ultrasonic sensor and a bluetooth module.
For the sensor to work the NewPing files should be installed in the Arduino libraries folder.
The code could be used for a three or four wheel car-robot which can be purchased from ebay.
